PieChartWithQWT
===============
Pie Chart with QWT is a little application able to show a pie chart using QWT library. This idea (allow me to use it) is born because in a project that I was developing I used QWT to make some plots and when I looked for a pie chart there only one chance to get it, using the little pie chart inside Cpu Plot example. This project re-implements the pie chart inside Cpu Plot in order to create a more dynamic and simple one.

In fact, to create a pie chart with this project only the names, the colors and the sector percentages are needed. It acts as a wrapper and any other customization is not needed.
